# Flex Web Application
## Description

A basic Flex client application and a BlazeDS server, ready to run in JBoss.
The client has a button that connects to the server using a RemoteObject.

## Features

* FlexMojos based.
* Apache Flex 4.11 for the Client.
* Adobe BlazeDS for the server.

## Notes

Not all maven artifacts are available in the public Maven repositories, you have to create some of these yourself. It is not possible to publish them because of copyright constraints.

* Adobe BlazeDS can be constructed from the BlazeDS binary that you can download from Adobe. In the near future Apache will provide a BlazeDS version as well.
* You have to "Mavenize" the Apache Flex 4.11 SDK using the tools provided on the Apache Flex website.

## Conclusion

Flex & BlazeDS & ActionScript are an amazing framework, very pleasant to work with.
Popularity has diminished a bit since Adobe decided not to support it anymore and to open source it.
On the Internet you can find a lot of Blogposts in the period 2006-2009, but after that its popularity seems to have faded.
Apache seems to embrace Flex and seems to be willing to support it, which is a good sign.
The biggest contender is HTML5 and JavaScript, but at this point in time Flex is much more fun to work with.
